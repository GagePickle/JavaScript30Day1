# JavaScript30 Day 1

This repository contains the completed Day 1 challenge from the online course JavaScript30 by Wes Bos.

In this challenge a JavaScript Drum Kit is made. This uses the ascii codes for each key that is used in the drumkit, in order to add an 'EventListener' that plays the keys associated audio file. CSS transitions and styles are also used to highlight the key on screen when it is pressed.
