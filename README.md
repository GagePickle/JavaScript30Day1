# JavaScript30 Day 1

This repository contains the completed Day 1 challenge from the online course JavaScript30 by Wes Bos.

In this challenge a JavaScript Drum Kit is made. This uses the ascii codes for each key that is used in the drumkit, in order to add an 'EventListener' that plays the keys associated audio file. CSS transitions and styles are also used to highlight the key on screen when it is pressed.

The challenge has been completed in a more modern way than Wes Bos shows in his original tutorial. JavaScript modules are used to import and export functionality between files, resulting in cleaner code that is easier to make changes to. ES6 arrow functions are also used when possible in place of the function keyword.
